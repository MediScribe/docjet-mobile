# DocJet Mobile: Architecture Documentation

This document outlines the architecture for the DocJet Mobile app, which provides audio recording, transcription, and playback capabilities. The architecture follows a **Feature-Sliced Clean Architecture** approach for maintainability, testability, and scalability.

***Note (July 2024): This document reflects the current architecture state including recent refactoring work on logging standardization and file path handling.***

## 1. System Overview

DocJet Mobile is an audio recording and transcription application that allows users to:
1. Record audio
2. Store recordings locally
3. Send recordings for transcription
4. View and play recordings with their transcripts

The following high-level diagram illustrates the overall system architecture and data flow:

```

### 2.1 Layer Responsibilities

* **Core Layer**: Contains application-wide utilities, abstractions, and configurations
* **Feature Modules**: Self-contained functional units with their own Clean Architecture layers
* **External Dependencies**: Third-party libraries and services managed via adapters and interfaces

### 2.2 Clean Architecture Within Features

Each feature follows Clean Architecture with these layers:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Domain [Domain Layer]
        Entities[Entities & Models]
        Interfaces[Interfaces & Contracts]
        UseCases[Use Cases]
    end
    
    subgraph Data [Data Layer]
        Repositories[Repository Implementations]
        DataSources[Data Sources]
        Services[Service Implementations]
        Adapters[External Service Adapters]
    end
    
    subgraph Presentation [Presentation Layer]
        UI[UI Components]
        StateManagement[Cubits/BLoCs]
    end
    
    %% Dependencies
    Presentation --> Domain
    Data --> Domain
    
    %% No dependency from Domain to other layers
    
    %% Styling
    style Domain fill:#e6f7ff,stroke:#1890ff,stroke-width:2px
    style Data fill:#f6ffed,stroke:#52c41a,stroke-width:2px
    style Presentation fill:#fff7e6,stroke:#fa8c16,stroke-width:2px
```

#### Domain Layer

    participant Cubit as AudioListCubit
    participant Repo as AudioRecorderRepository
    participant RemoteDS as TranscriptionRemoteDataSource
    participant LocalStore as LocalJobStore
    participant Merger as TranscriptionMergeService
    
    Cubit->>Repo: loadTranscriptions()
    Repo->>RemoteDS: getUserJobs()
    RemoteDS-->>Repo: Either<ApiFailure, List<Transcription>> remoteJobsResult
    Repo->>LocalStore: getAllLocalJobs()
    LocalStore-->>Repo: Either<CacheFailure, List<LocalJob>> localJobsResult
    
    alt Failed Local Fetch
      Repo-->>Cubit: Left(CacheFailure)
    else Successful Local Fetch
      alt Failed Remote Fetch (and no local jobs)
        Repo-->>Cubit: Left(ApiFailure)
      else Merge Needed
        Repo->>Merger: mergeJobs(remoteJobs, localJobs)
        Merger-->>Repo: List<Transcription> mergedList
        Repo-->>Cubit: Right(mergedList)
      end
    end
```

## 4. Audio Playback Architecture

The audio playback system has been refactored and standardized on `just_audio`. This architecture uses adapters and mappers to isolate the application from the specific audio library implementation.

### 4.1 Playback Components Overview

This diagram shows the high-level flow of control and state updates during playback.

```mermaid

    UI[AudioPlayerWidget] --> Cubit[AudioListCubit]
    Cubit --> Service[AudioPlaybackService]
    Service --> Mapper[PlaybackStateMapper]
    Service --> Adapter[AudioPlayerAdapter]
    Adapter --> Library[just_audio]
    Library -- Raw Events --> Adapter
    Adapter -- Domain Events --> Mapper
    Mapper -- PlaybackState Stream --> Service
    Service -- PlaybackState Updates --> Cubit
    Cubit -- State --> UI

### 4.3 Key Playback Components

#### Domain Layer
* **`AudioPlayerAdapter` Interface**:
  * Abstracts audio player operations
  * Provides streams for player events
  * Includes `getDuration()` method for retrieving audio file length

* **`PlaybackState` Entity**:
  * Represents business-level playback states (initial, loading, playing, paused, stopped, completed, error)
  * Created using Freezed for immutability and union types

* **`DomainPlayerState` Enum**:
  * Abstracts library-specific player states to domain-specific states
  * Provides clear state transitions for the mapper

* **`PlaybackStateMapper` Interface**:
  * Defines contract for transforming raw player events to business states
  * Combines position, duration, and state events into a unified state

* **`AudioPlaybackService` Interface**:
  * Provides high-level playback API (play, pause, resume, seek, stop)
  * Exposes combined playback state stream

#### Data Layer
* **`AudioPlayerAdapterImpl`**:
  * Wraps `just_audio` library
  * Maps raw player states to domain states
  * Handles library-specific edge cases
  * Provides duration retrieval through the adapter

* **`PlaybackStateMapperImpl`**:
  * Combines various input streams into a coherent PlaybackState
  * Uses RxDart for stream transformation
  * Maintains internal state for consistency

* **`AudioPlaybackServiceImpl`**:
  * Orchestrates audio playback using the adapter
  * Manages playback context (current file, etc.)
  * Exposes the mapper's output stream

#### Presentation Layer
* **`AudioListCubit`**:
  * Manages UI state using the BLoC pattern
  * Subscribes to service streams
  * Preserves playback context across state changes
  * Handles errors and edge cases

* **`AudioPlayerWidget`**:
  * Renders playback controls and progress
  * Dispatches user actions to the cubit
  * Manages local UI state for smooth interactions

### 4.4 Critical Implementation Details

**Critical Wiring in Dependency Injection**:

```dart
sl.registerLazySingleton<AudioPlaybackService>(() {
  // Resolve dependencies first
  final adapter = sl<AudioPlayerAdapter>();
  final mapper = sl<PlaybackStateMapper>();

  // **** THE CRITICAL WIRING STEP ****
  // Initialize the mapper with the adapter's streams
  // We MUST cast mapper back to its implementation type to access initialize
  (mapper as PlaybackStateMapperImpl).initialize(
    positionStream: adapter.onPositionChanged,
    durationStream: adapter.onDurationChanged,
    completeStream: adapter.onPlayerComplete,
    playerStateStream: adapter.onPlayerStateChanged,
  );
  // ***********************************

  // Now create the service instance with the wired dependencies
  return AudioPlaybackServiceImpl(
    audioPlayerAdapter: adapter,
    playbackStateMapper: mapper,
  );
});
```

This crucial wiring connects the streams from the adapter to the mapper, ensuring events flow correctly through the system.

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 5.1 Centralized Logging System (COMPLETED)

The application uses a standardized, centralized logging system. This architecture was implemented as part of Step 1 in the refactoring plan.

```mermaid
graph TB
    App[Application Code] --> LoggerFactory[LoggerFactory]
    LoggerFactory --> Logger[Logger Instances]
    Logger --> Output[Log Output]
    Config[Configuration] --> LoggerFactory
    
    %% Styling
    style App fill:#f9f0ff,stroke:#722ed1,stroke-width:1px
    style LoggerFactory fill:#e6f7ff,stroke:#1890ff,stroke-width:2px
    style Logger fill:#f6ffed,stroke:#52c41a,stroke-width:2px
    style Output fill:#fff7e6,stroke:#fa8c16,stroke-width:2px
    style Config fill:#f9f0ff,stroke:#722ed1,stroke-width:1px
```

#### Key Components
* **`LoggerFactory`**: Creates and configures loggers with consistent settings
* **Component-specific Logging**: Each component has its own logger with configurable levels
* **Runtime Log Control**: Log levels can be adjusted dynamically
* **Testing Support**: Comprehensive testing utilities for verifying logs

#### Implementation Pattern
```dart
class MyComponent {
  // Component-specific logger
  final logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyComponent, level: Level.off);
  
  // Optional tag for consistent logging
  static final _tag = logTag(MyComponent);
  
  // Optional debug enabler
  static void enableDebugLogs() => LoggerFactory.setLogLevel(MyComponent, Level.debug);
  
  void doSomething() {
    logger.d('$_tag doSomething: Started');
    try {
      // Implementation
      logger.d('$_tag doSomething: Completed');
    } catch (e, s) {
      logger.e('$_tag doSomething: Failed', error: e, stackTrace: s);
      rethrow;
    }
  }
}
```

### 5.2 File Path Handling (COMPLETED)

The application uses a robust, centralized file path handling system. This architecture was implemented as part of Step 8 in the refactoring plan.

```mermaid
graph TB
    App[Application Code] --> FileSystem[FileSystem Interface]
    FileSystem --> IoFileSystem[IoFileSystem Implementation]
    IoFileSystem --> PathResolver[PathResolver]
    IoFileSystem --> DartIO[dart:io File APIs]
    PathResolver --> Platform[Platform-specific Path Logic]
    
    %% Styling
    style App fill:#f9f0ff,stroke:#722ed1,stroke-width:1px
    style FileSystem fill:#e6f7ff,stroke:#1890ff,stroke-width:2px
    style IoFileSystem fill:#f6ffed,stroke:#52c41a,stroke-width:2px
    style PathResolver fill:#f6ffed,stroke:#52c41a,stroke-width:2px
    style DartIO fill:#fff7e6,stroke:#fa8c16,stroke-width:2px
    style Platform fill:#fff7e6,stroke:#fa8c16,stroke-width:2px
```

#### Key Components
* **`FileSystem` Interface**: Single access point for all file operations
* **`PathResolver`**: Handles platform-specific path resolution (internal only)
* **Relative Path Storage**: All stored paths are relative to app's container directory
* **Clear Error Handling**: Fast failure with explicit error messages

#### Implementation Pattern
```dart
class MyComponent {
  final FileSystem _fileSystem;
  
  MyComponent(this._fileSystem);
  
  Future<void> processFile(String relativePath) async {
    // Check if file exists
    final exists = await _fileSystem.fileExists(relativePath);
    if (!exists) {
      throw FileNotFoundException('File not found: $relativePath');
    }
    
    // Read file
    final bytes = await _fileSystem.readFile(relativePath);
    
    // Process data...
    
    // Write result
    await _fileSystem.writeFile('results/$relativePath', processedBytes);
  }
}
```

## 6. Upcoming Architectural Improvements

Based on the refactoring plan, the following architectural improvements are in progress or planned:

### 6.1 Fixing the Seek API (IN PROGRESS)
* **Problem**: The adapter's `seek` method takes a `filePath` parameter but doesn't use it
* **Solution**: Create a new adapter interface with a simplified `seek(Duration)` method
* **Status**: In progress
* **Impact**: Clearer responsibility separation and more intuitive API

### 6.2 Standardizing Error Handling (PLANNED)
* **Problem**: Inconsistent error handling across components
* **Solution**: Standardize error types and propagation patterns
* **Status**: Planned
* **Impact**: Better error recovery and user feedback

### 6.3 Simplifying Stream Flow (PLANNED)
* **Problem**: Complex stream transformation in mappers
* **Solution**: Simplify stream handling and reduce unnecessary transformations
* **Status**: Planned
* **Impact**: Performance improvements and code simplification

### 6.4 Future Improvements
* **Reducing Stateful Components**: Consolidating state management
* **Reducing Coupling**: Better encapsulation with context objects
* **Improving UI Performance**: Enhanced rendering and responsiveness

## 7. Testing Strategy

The architecture enables comprehensive testing at all levels:

    style IntegrationTests fill:#f6ffed,stroke:#52c41a,stroke-width:2px
    style UITests fill:#fff7e6,stroke:#fa8c16,stroke-width:2px
```

### Domain Layer Tests
* Pure Dart unit tests
* No external dependencies
* Focus on business logic

### Data Layer Tests
* Mocked external dependencies
* Test repositories, adapters, and services in isolation
* Verify external API contract compliance

### Presentation Layer Tests
* Cubit/BLoC tests for state management
* Widget tests for UI components
* Mocked domain services

### Integration Tests
* Test component interactions
* Verify correct event propagation
* May use fake implementations

## 8. Conclusion

The DocJet Mobile architecture demonstrates a modern, maintainable approach to Flutter application development. While appearing complex at first glance, the architecture's separation of concerns and clear boundaries enable:

1. **Independent Testing**: Each component can be tested in isolation
2. **Parallel Development**: Features and layers can be developed concurrently
3. **Adaptability**: Implementation details can change without affecting core business logic
4. **Maintainability**: Clear responsibility boundaries reduce the risk of regressions

The ongoing refactoring efforts show a commitment to continuous improvement and addressing technical debt proactively rather than reactively.
