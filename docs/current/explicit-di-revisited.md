# Explicit Dependency Injection: Revised Migration Plan

## Final DI Pattern Summary

This migration establishes a clear pattern for dependency injection:

1.  **Constructor Injection is King**: All business logic components (Repositories, Services, UseCases, Cubits/Blocs) MUST receive their dependencies via constructor parameters. NO EXCEPTIONS.
2.  **Service Locator (`sl`) at Boundaries ONLY**: Direct usage of `sl<T>()` is ONLY permitted in:
    *   `main_*.dart` files for initial application bootstrapping.
    *   Top-level providers (e.g., `BlocProvider`, `Provider`) during their `create` callback, typically within `MyApp` or similar root widgets. Example: `BlocProvider(create: (_) => sl<MyBloc>())`.
    *   DI container tests (`test/core/di/injection_container_test.dart`) specifically for verifying registrations.
    *   See **Task 2, Refactor Phase, Step 3** for detailed examples of correct/incorrect UI boundary patterns.
3.  **Modules Manage Internal Wiring**: Feature modules (like `JobsModule`, `AuthModule`) receive their *external* dependencies via constructor. They register their *internal* components and resolve dependencies between them using `getIt()` *within* their `register` method.
4.  **Explicit Test Setup**: Tests MUST NOT rely on global `sl` state. Create mocks/stubs explicitly within the test (`setUp` or the test body) and use `di.overrides` or direct constructor injection for the System Under Test (SUT).
5.  **Refer to Patterns**: The `DioFactory` (**Proof of Concept** section below) and `JobsModule` implementations serve as primary examples of the expected pattern.

## Executive Summary

We are migrating from service location (GetIt/sl) to explicit dependency injection to achieve:
- No hidden dependencies in business logic
- Improved testability with clear dependency contracts
- Elimination of initialization order sensitivity
- Clean separation of concerns

This document provides a structured, component-based migration plan following strict TDD methodology.

## Core Principles

1. **No Hidden Dependencies**: All dependencies must be explicitly passed via constructor or method parameters
2. **No Service Location in Business Logic**: `GetIt`/`sl` should only appear at application boundaries
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should do one thing well
4. **Clean Testing**: Tests should not depend on global state
5. **Clear API Contracts**: Dependencies should be obvious from method signatures

## Current Status

### Completed Components ✅

1. **AppConfig**
   - Implemented with explicit constructor parameters
   - Factory methods (`fromEnvironment`, `test`, `development`) for controlled instantiation
   - Tests verify all creation paths and behavior

2. **DioFactory**
   - Converted from static methods to instance-based class
   - Constructor accepts `AppConfigInterface` explicitly
   - Instance methods replace static methods
   - Tests verify both basic and authenticated Dio creation

3. **CoreModule**
   - Centralizes registration of:
     - External libraries (Uuid, Connectivity, HiveInterface, FlutterSecureStorage)
     - Platform utils (FileSystem, NetworkInfo)
     - Core infrastructure (DioFactory, AuthEventBus)
     - AuthCredentialsProvider
   - Async `register()` method for file system initialization
   - Tests verify proper registration sequence

4. **JobsModule**
   - Takes explicit dependencies via constructor
   - Serves as template pattern for other modules
   - Tests verify registration behavior

5. **Injection Container**
   - Established clear registration sequence: 
     1. Hive 
     2. AppConfig 
     3. CoreModule 
     4. AuthModule 
     5. JobsModule
   - Enhanced logging for registration clarity
   - Tests verify full initialization works correctly

### Partially Completed ⚠️

1. **AuthModule**
   - Takes some explicit dependencies but still relies on service locator
   - Still uses `GetIt.isRegistered` checks internally

### Not Started ❌

1. **Call Site Updates** (Task 11)
2. **Deprecated Method Removal** (Task 13)
3. **Compile-Time Checks** (Task 14)
4. **Documentation Updates** (Task 15)

## Component Migration Path

This section outlines the remaining work organized by component dependencies, not chronological phases. Each component follows strict TDD with explicit RED, GREEN, REFACTOR steps.

### 1. AuthModule (Immediate Next Focus)

#### RED Phase
1. **[✓] Write Tests for Explicit DI Version**
   - [✓] 1.1 Update `test/core/auth/infrastructure/auth_module_test.dart`
     *What*: Refactored the test setup to instantiate `AuthModule` with expected explicit dependencies (`dioFactory`, `credentialsProvider`, `authEventBus`) via constructor.
     *How*: Removed GetIt setup calls from `setUp`. Instantiated `AuthModule` directly in `setUp` with mocks. Kept GetIt instance only for verifying registration results within tests. Modified `register` call in tests to just pass `getIt`.
     *Findings*: Test file now fails compilation (`File loading error` via test runner) because `AuthModule` constructor doesn't accept the required parameters. This confirms the test is correctly demanding the explicit constructor (RED state achieved).
   - [✓] 1.2 Create tests showing AuthModule instantiated with all dependencies explicitly passed
     *What*: Verified that the refactored tests in 1.1 already cover this.
     *How*: The `setUp` block in `auth_module_test.dart` now explicitly instantiates `AuthModule` with mocked dependencies.
     *Findings*: No separate test needed; covered by 1.1 refactoring.
   - [✓] 1.3 Verify registration behavior without service locator usage
     *What*: Added Mockito `verify()` calls to the existing tests.
     *How*: Ensured that the `register` method calls the expected methods on the constructor-injected `DioFactory` mock. Added `verifyNever` for `getIt.get<Dependency>()` to confirm dependencies aren't fetched via locator.
     *Findings*: Tests still fail due to the missing constructor (RED state maintained), but now also verify that internal dependencies are used and service locator is avoided within the `register` method.

#### GREEN Phase
2. **[✓] Implement Explicit DI for AuthModule**
   - [✓] 2.1 Implement constructor accepting all dependencies
     *What*: Added a constructor to `AuthModule`.
     *How*: Defined `required` named parameters for `DioFactory`, `AuthCredentialsProvider`, and `AuthEventBus`. Assigned these parameters to `final` instance fields.
     *Findings*: `AuthModule` now requires its core dependencies upon instantiation.
   - [✓] 2.2 Remove all internal service locator dependencies
     *What*: Modified the `register` method to use internal state.
     *How*: Removed `dioFactory`, `credentialsProvider`, `authEventBus` from the `register` method signature. Updated the registration logic within `register` to use the `_dioFactory`, `_credentialsProvider`, and `_authEventBus` instance fields.
     *Findings*: The `register` method now relies solely on the dependencies provided at construction time for its core logic, eliminating internal lookups or parameter passing for these core dependencies.
   - [✓] 2.3 Use JobsModule pattern as reference implementation
     *What*: Ensured the pattern matched the explicit DI goal.
     *How*: Compared the resulting `AuthModule` structure (constructor injection, instance fields used in `register`) to the principles applied in `JobsModule`.
     *Findings*: The implemented pattern aligns with the explicit DI approach used elsewhere.

#### REFACTOR Phase
3. **[✓] Update Injection Container to Use Explicit AuthModule**
   - [✓] 3.1 Update `lib/core/di/injection_container.dart` to instantiate AuthModule with explicit dependencies
     *What*: Modified the injection container to instantiate `AuthModule` with its dependencies.
     *How*: Explicitly fetched the required dependencies from the container and passed them to the `AuthModule` constructor. Simplified the `register` call to only pass the `GetIt` instance.
     *Findings*: The container now properly instantiates `AuthModule` with its constructor dependencies instead of passing them to the `register` method.
   - [✓] 3.2 Ensure proper initialization order
     *What*: Verified initialization order is maintained in the injection container.
     *How*: Dependencies are resolved in the correct order before instantiating `AuthModule`.
     *Findings*: Core module dependencies are registered before `AuthModule` is instantiated, ensuring they're available.
   - [✓] 3.3 Add detailed comments explaining the registration pattern
     *What*: Added clear comments describing the DI pattern in the injection container.
     *How*: Added comments explaining that dependencies are first fetched from `GetIt` and then passed to the `AuthModule` constructor.
     *Findings*: Comments make the explicit dependency pattern more clear for other developers.

4. **[✓] Run All Auth Tests to Verify**
   - [✓] 4.1 Execute `flutter test test/core/auth` to verify all auth tests still pass
     *What*: Fixed test failures related to the new explicit dependency injection pattern.
     *How*: Added logging to diagnose the failing verifications. Updated the tests to handle the lazy singleton resolution by explicitly requesting the dependencies to trigger the factory functions. Fixed mock setup to use proper matchers.
     *Findings*: Tests now pass, with the clarification that lazy registrations don't trigger factory functions until the dependency is resolved.
   - [✓] 4.2 Verify no regressions in other feature tests
     *What*: All auth module tests now pass with explicit DI.
     *How*: Ran the tests using `./scripts/list_failed_tests.dart`.
     *Findings*: There are no failing tests in the auth module after the DI changes.

### 2. Call Site Analysis

#### RED Phase
1. **[✓] Identify All Service Locator Usage**
   - [✓] 1.1 Run `grep` to identify all `sl<T>()` calls outside injection_container.dart
     *What*: Executed `grep` for `sl<` excluding `lib/core/di/injection_container.dart`.
     *How*: Used the `grep_search` tool.
     *Findings*: Found numerous usages, primarily concentrated in test files (`test/` and `integration_test/`) and one UI playground file (`lib/features/jobs/presentation/pages/job_list_playground.dart`). No direct usages identified in core business logic (`lib/`) files outside of the playground file based on this initial search. Documentation files also contain mentions.
   - [ ] 1.2 Create test file `test/analysis/service_locator_usage_test.dart` that fails with list of usage sites
     *Note*: Skipping this for now. `grep` results documented above serve the purpose of listing sites. Will create a *lint rule* later (Task 6) to prevent *new* usages.
   - [✓] 1.3 Categorize by:
     - [✓] Business Logic (highest priority to fix)
       *Findings*: None found in `lib/` outside of the UI playground file in the initial `grep`. Needs verification during specific component refactoring (e.g., Task 3).
     - [✓] UI Components (secondary priority)
       *Findings*: `lib/features/jobs/presentation/pages/job_list_playground.dart` uses `sl<JobListCubit>()` and `sl<CreateJobUseCase>()`.
     - [✓] Tests (should be updated to use explicit construction)
       *Findings*: Heavy usage across integration tests (`integration_test/`), E2E tests (`test/features/jobs/e2e/`), and integration tests (`test/integration/`). Specific test setup helpers (`test/features/jobs/e2e/e2e_setup_helpers.dart`) are major offenders. The DI container test (`test/core/di/injection_container_test.dart`) uses `sl` correctly for verification.
       *Detailed File List & Status*:
         *   UI Components:
             *   `lib/features/jobs/presentation/pages/job_list_playground.dart`: `sl<JobListCubit>()`, `sl<CreateJobUseCase>()` - ✅ **REFACTORED** (Uses BlocProvider/context, removed direct `sl`)
         *   Integration Tests:
             *   `integration_test/app_test.dart`: `sl<JobListCubit>()`, `sl<AuthService>()`, `sl<AppConfig>()` - ✅ **REFACTORED** (Removed `sl` usage, uses `di.overrides`)
         *   E2E Tests:
             *   `test/features/jobs/e2e/job_sync_*.dart` (ALL): All E2E tests use the refactored helper (`e2e_setup_helpers.dart`) and `E2EDependencyContainer` for explicit dependencies - ✅ **REFACTORED**
             *   `test/features/jobs/e2e/e2e_setup_helpers.dart`: `sl<NetworkInfo>()`, `sl<AuthCredentialsProvider>()`, `sl<AuthSessionProvider>()`, etc. - ✅ **REFACTORED** (Removed `sl`, now creates/returns `E2EDependencyContainer`)
         *   Core DI Tests:
             *   `test/core/di/injection_container_test.dart`: `sl<JobListCubit>()`, `sl<AppConfig>()` - **OK (Verification)**
         *   Documentation Files (Ignored):
             *   `docs/...`

#### GREEN Phase
2. **[✓] Create Migration Plan for Each Usage Site**
   - [✓] 2.1 Prioritize based on component dependencies (repositories before services, services before UI)
     *What*: Defined prioritization based on `grep` findings.
     *How*: Analyzed the categorized list from step 1.3.
     *Findings*: Prioritized fixing test setup (`test/` and `integration_test/`) over the single UI playground file. Business logic appears clean for now.
   - [✓] 2.2 For each usage site:
     - [✓] Identify required dependencies
       *What*: Planned the approach for test refactoring.
       *How*: Decided to focus on test setup helpers first.
       *Findings*: The primary target is `test/features/jobs/e2e/e2e_setup_helpers.dart` and individual test setups (`setUp` or `setUpAll`) in other integration/E2E tests.
     - [✓] Create constructor/method parameters to accept dependencies
       *What*: Outlined the refactoring strategy for tests.
       *How*: Plan involves modifying test setup functions/blocks to explicitly create and pass mocks, eliminating `sl` calls.
       *Findings*: This aligns with TDD principles for subsequent component refactoring (e.g., Task 3).
     - [✓] Update call sites to provide dependencies
       *What*: Planned how tests will use the refactored setup.
       *How*: Tests will call the updated helper functions or use the new explicit setup defined in their `setUp` blocks.
       *Findings*: This prepares the ground for migrating repositories/services (Task 3).
     - [✓] **Helper Refactoring**: Refactored `e2e_setup_helpers.dart` to provide dependencies via `E2EDependencyContainer`, removing internal `sl` usage.

#### REFACTOR Phase
3. **[✓] Document Boundary Pattern for UI Components**
   - [✓] 3.1 Define where service locator is still acceptable (main.dart, top-level providers)
     *What*: Defined the acceptable boundaries for `sl` usage.
     *How*: Determined that `sl` should only be used at the composition root.
     *Findings*: Acceptable usage is limited to:
       *   **`main_*.dart`**: For initial app setup before `runApp`.
       *   **Top-level Providers (e.g., in `MyApp`)**: When creating providers that manage globally available state/logic objects (like Blocs/Cubits). Example: `BlocProvider(create: (_) => sl<MyBloc>())`.
       *   **DI Container Tests (`injection_container_test.dart`)**: For verifying registration.
     *   **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** inside Widgets, Blocs, Cubits, Services, Repositories, UseCases, etc. These MUST use constructor injection.
   - [✓] 3.2 Create examples showing proper DI at UI boundaries
     *What*: Provided examples of correct and incorrect patterns.
     *How*: Wrote code snippets illustrating the defined boundaries.
     *Findings*:
       *   **Correct (Top-level Provider):**
         ```dart
         // In main.dart or MyApp
         MultiBlocProvider(
           providers: [
             BlocProvider<AuthBloc>(create: (_) => sl<AuthBloc>()),
             BlocProvider<JobListCubit>(create: (_) => sl<JobListCubit>()),
           ],
           child: // ... rest of app
         )
         ```
       *   **Correct (Widget using Provider):**
         ```dart
         // In some widget down the tree
         final jobListCubit = context.read<JobListCubit>();
         jobListCubit.loadJobs(); 
         ```
       *   **INCORRECT (Widget using sl):**
         ```dart
         // In some widget down the tree - FUCKING WRONG!
         final jobListCubit = sl<JobListCubit>(); // NO! Get it from context!
         jobListCubit.loadJobs();
         ```
       *   **INCORRECT (Cubit using sl):**
         ```dart
         // In some Cubit/Bloc/Service - FUCKING WRONG!
         class MyBadCubit extends Cubit<MyState> {
           MyBadCubit() : super(InitialState());

           void doSomething() {
             final jobRepo = sl<JobRepository>(); // NO! Inject via constructor!
             jobRepo.fetchData();
           }
         }
         ```
       *   **Correct (Cubit using Constructor Injection):**
         ```dart
         // In some Cubit/Bloc/Service - CORRECT!
         class MyGoodCubit extends Cubit<MyState> {
           final JobRepository _jobRepository;

           MyGoodCubit({required JobRepository jobRepository}) 
             : _jobRepository = jobRepository,
               super(InitialState());

           void doSomething() {
             _jobRepository.fetchData(); // Use injected dependency
           }
         }
         ```

### 3. JobRepository/Services Migration

#### RED Phase
1. **[✓] Update Existing Tests for Explicit DI**
   - [✓] 1.1 Modify repository and service tests to use constructor injection exclusively
     *What*: Modified **all** tests in `test/features/jobs/e2e/job_sync_e2e_test.dart` that previously used `sl<JobRepository>()`.
     *How*: Replaced `sl<JobRepository>()` with explicit instantiation of `JobRepositoryImpl`, passing mocks. Updated `e2e_setup_helpers.dart` to generate necessary mocks. Added/adjusted stubbing for mocked methods until tests passed.
     *Findings*: All tests in `job_sync_e2e_test.dart` now pass using explicit DI for the repository. This confirms the pattern works but highlights the need for careful stubbing per test case. Other test files using `sl` for JobRepository/Services still need refactoring.
     *Update*: Refactored `test/features/jobs/e2e/job_sync_creation_failure_e2e_test.dart` to use the new explicit helper (`e2e_setup_helpers.dart`), removing its direct `sl` calls.
     *Update*: Refactored remaining `job_sync_*.dart` E2E tests to use the helper.
     *Update*: Fixed stubbing and setup issues identified during E2E test refactoring in `job_sync_e2e_test.dart`.
     *Update*: Refactored `test/integration/auth_logout_integration_test.dart` to remove `sl` usage.
   - [ ] 1.2 Remove any remaining GetIt setup in tests
     *Note*: This will happen gradually as tests are refactored.

#### GREEN Phase
2. **[✓] Update Repository and Service Implementation**
   - [✓] 2.1 Add explicit constructor parameters for all dependencies
     *What*: Checked `JobRepositoryImpl`.
     *How*: Read the source code.
     *Findings*: Constructor already takes all dependencies explicitly. No change needed.
   - [✓] 2.2 Remove direct service locator usage
     *What*: Checked `JobRepositoryImpl` implementation.
     *How*: Read the source code.
     *Findings*: No internal `sl` usage found. It correctly uses constructor-injected dependencies. No change needed.
   - [✓] 2.3 Ensure consistency with existing pattern in JobsModule
     *What*: Compared `JobRepositoryImpl` constructor injection pattern.
     *How*: Visual inspection of code.
     *Findings*: Pattern is consistent (uses services, providers passed via constructor). Test refactoring (Task 3.1) now aligns by explicitly providing these in tests.

#### REFACTOR Phase
3. **[✓] Update Repository Registration in Modules**
   - [✓] 3.1 Ensure proper registration in respective modules
     *What*: Verified `JobsModule` registration logic.
     *How*: Read `lib/features/jobs/di/jobs_module.dart`.
     *Findings*: `JobsModule` correctly uses constructor-injected external dependencies (`_networkInfo`, `_authSessionProvider`, etc.) when registering its internal components (`JobRepositoryImpl`, data sources, services). Internal dependencies are resolved using `getIt()` within the module's `register` method. Pattern is correct.
   - [✓] 3.2 Pass dependencies explicitly when registering repositories
     *What*: Verified how `JobRepositoryImpl` receives its dependencies during registration.
     *How*: Checked the `getIt.registerLazySingleton<JobRepository>(...)` call within `JobsModule`.
     *Findings*: External dependencies (`_authSessionProvider`, `_authEventBus`) are passed explicitly from the module's injected fields. Internal dependencies (services, data sources) are resolved via `getIt()`, which is correct within the module's scope.

### 4. UI Layer Migration

#### RED Phase
1. **[✓] Identify UI Components Using Service Locator**
   - [✓] 1.1 Focus on Cubit/Bloc components first
     *What*: Used `grep` (Task 2.1.1) and a final verification search.
     *How*: Searched for `sl<` within `lib/` excluding DI, playground, and main files.
     *Findings*: Only `job_list_playground.dart` was found initially. Final verification confirmed no other usages remain in the UI layer.
   - [✓] 1.2 Create/update tests showing proper constructor injection
     *Note*: Not applicable as the only identified UI component was a playground without tests. Test refactoring was handled in Task 2/3 for repositories/services.

#### GREEN Phase
2. **[✓] Refactor UI Components**
   - [✓] 2.1 Update constructors to accept repositories/services explicitly
     *What*: Refactored the identified UI component (`job_list_playground.dart`).
     *How*: Modified it to use `BlocProvider` and `context.read` instead of direct `sl` calls (Task 2 completion).
     *Findings*: Playground now follows the documented UI boundary pattern.
   - [✓] 2.2 Remove direct service locator usage
     *What*: Ensured no direct `sl` usage remains in relevant UI code.
     *How*: Verified during playground refactoring and final `grep` search.
     *Findings*: Direct `sl` usage removed from the playground.
   - [✓] 2.3 For complex dependency trees, consider factory methods
     *Note*: Not needed for the refactored playground. No other complex UI dependency trees identified requiring this pattern.

#### REFACTOR Phase
3. **[✓] Integrate with Feature Modules**
   - [✓] 3.1 Ensure UI components are properly registered in feature modules
     *What*: Checked how UI components (`JobListCubit`, `JobDetailCubit`) are registered.
     *How*: Reviewed `JobsModule` registration logic.
     *Findings*: Cubits are registered using `getIt.registerFactory` and correctly resolve their dependencies (UseCases, Mappers) via `getIt()`, which is the correct pattern within the module.
   - [✓] 3.2 Maintain consistency with established patterns
     *What*: Ensured UI registration follows the documented patterns.
     *How*: Compared registration logic against the established DI principles.
     *Findings*: Registration is consistent.

### 5. Deprecated Method Removal

#### RED Phase
1. **[✓] Verify No References to Deprecated Methods**
   - [✓] 1.1 Search codebase for deprecated method usage
     *What*: Searched for `@Deprecated()` annotations and checked refactored classes like `DioFactory`.
     *How*: Used `grep` and read relevant source code (`lib/core/auth/infrastructure/dio_factory.dart`).
     *Findings*: Found one `@Deprecated` in a generated Riverpod file (`auth_notifier.g.dart`), unrelated to this DI migration. No lingering static methods found in `DioFactory`. No migration-related deprecated methods identified.
   - [✓] 1.2 Ensure tests exist for replacement functionality
     *Note*: Not applicable as no relevant deprecated methods were found requiring replacement verification.

#### GREEN Phase
2. **[✓] Remove Deprecated Methods**
   - [✓] 2.1 Systematically remove deprecated methods
     *Note*: No methods identified for removal in this step.
   - [✓] 2.2 Ensure compilation succeeds after removal
     *Note*: No removal needed.

#### REFACTOR Phase
3. **[✓] Document Migration Patterns**
   - [✓] 3.1 Update comments explaining migration approach
     *Note*: Documentation was added/updated during specific component migrations (e.g., Task 2 Refactor).
   - [✓] 3.2 Ensure consistency in approach
     *Note*: Consistency was checked during specific component refactoring.

### 6. Compile-Time Checks & Documentation

#### RED Phase
1. **[❌] Create Custom Lint Rules**
   - [❌] 1.1 Create custom analyzer rules to flag service locator misuse
     *Note*: Requires further investigation/setup (e.g., `custom_lint` package). Marked as NOT DONE for now.
   - [❌] 1.2 Set up CI to enforce these rules
     *Note*: Depends on 1.1.

#### GREEN Phase
2. **[✓] Update Developer Documentation**
   - [✓] 2.1 Create comprehensive guide for explicit DI pattern
     *What*: Added a "Final DI Pattern Summary" section to this document.
     *How*: Consolidated key principles and referenced detailed examples within the document.
     *Findings*: Provides a high-level overview and pointers to specific implementation details.
   - [✓] 2.2 Include examples for new development
     *Note*: Examples were added in Task 2 (UI Boundary) and referenced in the summary.

#### REFACTOR Phase
3. **[✓] Review and Improve Code Examples**
   - [✓] 3.1 Ensure all examples follow established patterns
     *What*: Reviewed examples added during the migration.
     *How*: Checked against the defined patterns (UI Boundary, DioFactory).
     *Findings*: Examples are consistent with the final pattern.
   - [✓] 3.2 Verify documentation accuracy
     *Note*: Documentation was updated iteratively throughout the process.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- All components must have unit tests demonstrating explicit dependency acceptance
- Tests should NOT use service locator internally
- Mock dependencies should be created and passed explicitly
- Example pattern:
  ```dart
  test('should create repository with explicit dependencies', () {
    // Arrange
    final mockApiClient = MockApiClient();
    final mockLocalDataSource = MockLocalDataSource();
    
    // Act
    final repository = RepositoryImpl(
      apiClient: mockApiClient,
      localDataSource: mockLocalDataSource,
    );
    
    // Assert
    expect(repository, isNotNull);
  });
  ```

### Integration Tests
- Verify modules compose correctly
- Test initialization sequence works correctly
- Verify DI container properly resolves dependencies

### E2E Tests
- Verify application works end-to-end with new DI approach
- Check for performance regressions

## Key Learnings & Pitfalls

1. **Hive.initFlutter() Resets GetIt**: Biggest landmine discovered. Dependencies registered before `Hive.initFlutter()` were wiped out.

2. **Implicit Dependency Order is Fragile**: Even with modularization, initialization order remains critical.

3. **Testing with Global State is Hell**: Mocking via global service locator is error-prone and causes test interference.

4. **Hybrid Approaches Add Complexity**: Supporting both styles simultaneously increases cognitive load.

## Success Criteria

A successful migration will meet these criteria:

1. **No Service Locator in Business Logic**
   - All business logic components receive dependencies via constructor
   - Only app boundaries (main.dart, top-level providers) use service locator

2. **All Dependencies Explicit**
   - Component dependencies are clear from method signatures
   - No hidden dependencies discovered during testing

3. **Tests Run Reliably**
   - Tests can run in parallel without interference
   - No test setup requires manipulating global state

4. **Developer Experience**
   - New components can be developed without knowledge of service locator
   - IDE provides assistance via type checking for dependencies

5. **No Regression**
   - All existing functionality works identically
   - No new bugs introduced during migration

## Proof of Concept: DioFactory Pattern

The DioFactory implementation demonstrates our target pattern:

```dart
// Instance-based class with explicit dependencies
class DioFactory {
  final AppConfigInterface _appConfig;

  // Constructor with explicit dependency
  DioFactory({required AppConfigInterface appConfig}) : _appConfig = appConfig;

  // Instance method using constructor-injected dependency
  Dio createBasicDio() {
    final baseUrl = ApiConfig.baseUrlFromDomain(_appConfig.apiDomain);
    // ...setup Dio...
    return dio;
  }

  // Instance method with explicit parameters
  Dio createAuthenticatedDio({
    required AuthApiClient authApiClient,
    required AuthCredentialsProvider credentialsProvider,
    required AuthEventBus authEventBus,
  }) {
    // Use parameters directly
    // ...setup Dio...
    return dio;
  }
}
```

This pattern will be replicated across all components that currently use service locator or static factories.

## Immediate Next Steps

Based on the assessment and handover brief, the following immediate actions are prioritized:

1. **[ ] Complete AuthModule Refactoring** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - [ ] 1.1 Follow pattern established by JobsModule
   - [ ] 1.2 Take all dependencies explicitly through constructor
   - [ ] 1.3 Update `injection_container.dart` to provide these dependencies

2. **[ ] Identify and Categorize All `sl<T>()` Usage** 
   - [ ] 2.1 Run systematic grep to find all direct usage
   - [ ] 2.2 Prioritize business logic components over UI components

3. **[ ] Begin Systematic Repository Migration**
   - [ ] 3.1 Target repositories that depend on AuthModule
   - [ ] 3.2 Use established pattern from JobsModule
