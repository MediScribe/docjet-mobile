# TODO: Implement Delete All Jobs Feature

**Goal:** Add the ability for users to delete all their jobs in one operation, rather than having to delete them one by one. This improves user experience by streamlining cleanup operations and provides a clean slate without forcing logout/login.

**MANDATORY REPORTING RULE:** For **every** task/cycle below, **before check-off and moving on to the next todo**, the dev must (a) write a brief *Findings* paragraph summarizing *what was done and observed* and (b) a *Handover Brief* summarising status at the end of the cycle, edge-cases/gotchas, and next-step readiness **inside this doc** before ticking the checkbox. No silent check-offs allowed â€“ uncertainty gets you fucking fired. Like Mafee forgetting the shorts, don't be that guy.

## DONE

With these cycles we:
1. Created a DeleteAllJobsUseCase following clean architecture principles
2. Extended the JobRepository interface and implementation with deleteAllJobs method
3. Implemented the bulk deletion logic in JobDeleterService
4. Added deleteAllJobs method to JobListCubit with optimistic UI updates
5. Integrated the feature into the UI with proper confirmation dialogs
6. Updated documentation to reflect the new functionality

No bullshit, no uncertainty â€“ "We're not destroying their world, we're improving it."
