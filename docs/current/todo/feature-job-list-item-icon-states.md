# TODO: Implement Enhanced Job List Item Icon States

**Goal:** Refactor the `JobListItem` to display a dynamic icon representing the comprehensive status of a job, including its creation, sync progress, server processing state, completion, and various error conditions. This will provide users with clear, at-a-glance information about each job's lifecycle and any issues, replacing ambiguous or missing visual cues.

---

## Target Flow / Architecture

1.  **`JobUIIcon` Enum**: Define a new enum `JobUIIcon` in `lib/features/jobs/presentation/models/job_ui_icon.dart` (new file) that clearly represents all possible icon states (e.g., `created`, `pendingSync`, `syncError`, `syncFailed`, `fileIssue`, `processing`, `serverError`, `completed`, `pendingDeletion`, `unknown`).
2.  **`JobViewModel.uiIcon` Getter**: Implement a getter `uiIcon` within `lib/features/jobs/presentation/models/job_view_model.dart`. This getter will contain the logic to determine the correct `JobUIIcon` based on the job's `jobStatus`, `syncStatus`, and `hasFileIssue`. This logic will have a clear order of precedence for error states, using early returns rather than nested if-else statements for clarity and maintainability.
3.  **`JobListItem` Integration**: Modify `lib/features/jobs/presentation/widgets/job_list_item.dart` to:
    *   Consume `jobViewModel.uiIcon` instead of using the existing `_getJobItemIcon` and `_getIconColor` methods.
    *   Implement a private helper method `_buildIcon(JobUIIcon uiIcon)` that maps each `JobUIIcon` to a specific `Widget` (using `Icon` with appropriate `CupertinoIcons` and colors).
    *   Ensure the `unknown` state has a sensible fallback icon (e.g., `CupertinoIcons.question_circle`) so the UI never crashes.
4.  **Playground Verification**: Update `lib/features/jobs/presentation/pages/job_list_playground.dart` to include examples of jobs in all new icon states for easy visual verification.

**Mermaid Diagram of `uiIcon` Logic Precedence (Conceptual):**
```mermaid
graph TD
    Start[Job Data: jobStatus, syncStatus, hasFileIssue] --> A{Has File Issue?};
    A -- Yes --> FileIssueIcon[JobUIIcon.fileIssue];
    A -- No --> B{Sync Status Failed?};
    B -- Yes --> SyncFailedIcon[JobUIIcon.syncFailed];
    B -- No --> C{Sync Status Error?};
    C -- Yes --> SyncErrorIcon[JobUIIcon.syncError];
    C -- No --> D{JobStatus Server Error?};
    D -- Yes --> ServerErrorIcon[JobUIIcon.serverError];
    D -- No --> E{Pending Deletion?};
    E -- Yes --> PendingDeletionIcon[JobUIIcon.pendingDeletion];
    E -- No --> F{JobStatus Completed?};
    F -- Yes --> CompletedIcon[JobUIIcon.completed];
    F -- No --> G{JobStatus Created & Sync Pending?};
    G -- Yes --> CreatedIcon[JobUIIcon.created];
    G -- No --> H{JobStatus Submitted/Transcribing/Generated etc.?};
    H -- Yes --> ProcessingIcon[JobUIIcon.processing];
    H -- No --> DefaultIcon[JobUIIcon.unknown]; 
```

**MANDATORY REPORTING RULE:** For **every** task/cycle below, **before check-off and moving on to the next todo**, the dev must (a) write a brief *Findings* paragraph summarizing *what was done and observed* and (b) a *Handover Brief* summarising status at the end of the cycle, edge-cases/gotchas, and next-step readiness **inside this doc** before ticking the checkbox. No silent check-offs allowed â€“ uncertainty gets you fucking fired. Like Mafee forgetting the shorts, don't be that guy.

---

## Cycle 0: Setup & Prerequisite Definition

**Goal:** Define the core `JobUIIcon` enum and finalize the strategy for error icon granularity (specific vs. generic). This sets the foundation for all subsequent logic.

**MANDATORY REPORTING RULE:** After *each sub-task* below and *before* ticking its checkbox, you **MUST** add a **Findings** note *and* a **Handover Brief**. No silent check-offs. Uncertainty will get you fucking fired.

**APPLY MODEL ATTENTION**: The apply model is a bit tricky to work with! For large files, edits can take up to 20s; so you might need to double check if you don't get an affirmative answer right away. Go in smaller edits.

*   0.1. [ ] **Task:** Define `JobUIIcon` Enum.
    *   Action: Create `lib/features/jobs/presentation/models/job_ui_icon.dart` and define the `JobUIIcon` enum with the following initial values: `created`, `pendingSync`, `syncError`, `syncFailed`, `fileIssue`, `processing`, `serverError`, `completed`, `pendingDeletion`, `unknown` (as a fallback).
    *   Remember to use proper documentation for each enum value.
    *   Findings:
*   0.2. [ ] **Task:** Confirm Error Icon Strategy.
    *   Action: Review the proposed specific error icons (`syncError`, `syncFailed`, `fileIssue`, `serverError`). Decide if this level of granularity is desired or if a single generic `error` icon (merging these) is preferred. For now, we proceed with specific icons.
    *   Findings:
*   0.3. [ ] **Update Plan:** Based on findings (especially from 0.2), confirm or adjust the plan for subsequent cycles. The current plan assumes specific error icons.
    *   Findings:
*   0.4. [ ] **Handover Brief:**

**MANDATORY REPORTING RULE:** After *each sub-task* below and *before* ticking its checkbox, you **MUST** add a **Findings** note *and* a **Handover Brief** at the end of the cycle. No silent check-offs. Uncertainty will get you fucking fired.

## Cycle 3: Integrate `uiIcon` into `JobListItem`

**Goal:** Visually represent the derived `JobUIIcon` in the `JobListItem` by adding the icon mapping logic and displaying it.

**MANDATORY REPORTING RULE:** After *each sub-task* below and *before* ticking its checkbox, you **MUST** add a **Findings** note *and* a **Handover Brief** at the end of the cycle. No silent check-offs. Uncertainty will get you fucking fired.

*   3.1. [ ] **Research:** Identify suitable `CupertinoIcons` and appropriate semantic colors for each `JobUIIcon` state.
    *   Findings:
*   3.2. [ ] **Implement:** Add a private helper method `_buildIcon(JobUIIcon uiIcon)` to `JobListItem` that returns a `Widget` based on the `JobUIIcon`.
    *   Implementation File: `lib/features/jobs/presentation/widgets/job_list_item.dart`
    *   Make sure to handle each icon state including the `unknown` fallback.
    *   Use semantic colors from `AppColorTokens` for consistent styling.
    *   Findings:
*   3.3. [ ] **Implement:** Modify the `JobListItem`'s `build` method to call `jobViewModel.uiIcon` and use the result with `_buildIcon` to display the icon. Place it appropriately in the list item layout (e.g., leading widget).
    *   Remove the old `_getJobItemIcon` and `_getIconColor` methods that are being replaced.
    *   Implementation File: `lib/features/jobs/presentation/widgets/job_list_item.dart`
    *   Findings:

## Cycle 4: Update `JobListPlayground` for Visual Verification & Testing

**Goal:** Thoroughly test and visually verify all `JobUIIcon` states by updating the `JobListPlayground` with representative job examples.

**MANDATORY REPORTING RULE:** After *each sub-task* below and *before* ticking its checkbox, you **MUST** add a **Findings** note *and* a **Handover Brief** at the end of the cycle. No silent check-offs. Uncertainty will get you fucking fired.

    *   Action: Add new `JobViewModel` instances to the `_mockJobs` list in `lib/features/jobs/presentation/pages/job_list_playground.dart` to cover all defined `JobUIIcon` states. Ensure each mock job has the necessary `jobStatus`, `syncStatus`, and `hasFileIssue` to trigger the desired icon.
    *   Create at least one example for each icon state.
    *   Comment each mock job to clearly indicate which icon state it's demonstrating.
    *   Findings:
*   4.2. [ ] **Task:** (Optional) Add debug buttons/methods to `JobListPlayground`.
    *   Action: Consider adding temporary buttons or functions in the playground to create jobs that will specifically result in each error state (e.g., a "Create Job with Sync Fail" button) if static mocks are insufficient for dynamic testing.
    *   Findings:
*   4.3. [ ] **Manual Smoke Test:** Visually inspect the `JobListPlayground`.
    *   Action: Run the app and navigate to the `JobListPlayground`. Verify that each mock job (or dynamically created job) displays the correct icon and color according to its state. Check for visual consistency and clarity.

## DONE

With these cycles we:
1.  Defined a clear and extensible `JobUIIcon` enum for all job visual states.
2.  Centralized the complex state-to-icon mapping logic within `JobViewModel.uiIcon`, backed by comprehensive unit tests.
3.  Integrated the dynamic icons into `JobListItem` for clear visual feedback.
4.  Visually validated all icon states in the `JobListPlayground`.
