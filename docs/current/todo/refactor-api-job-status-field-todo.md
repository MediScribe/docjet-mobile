# TODO: API Field Refactoring - Replace "job_status" with "status"

**Goal:** Refactor our API interaction layer to use "status" instead of "job_status" for job status data, maintaining backward compatibility while minimizing codebase changes. This standardizes our API field naming convention without requiring a full-scale internal code refactoring, making the API more intuitive while keeping the project's internal structure intact.

graph TD
    A[Client App] -->|Uses internally| B[JobStatus enum]
    A -->|API Request| C[status field]
    A -->|Deserialization| D[job_status field]
    E[API Response] -->|Contains| C
    C -->|Mapped to| B
    D -->|Fallback for old API| B
```

**MANDATORY REPORTING RULE:** For **every** task/cycle below, **before check-off and moving on to the next todo**, the dev must (a) write a brief *Findings* paragraph summarizing *what was done and observed* and (b) a *Handover Brief* summarising status at the end of the cycle, edge-cases/gotchas, and next-step readiness **inside this doc** before ticking the checkbox. No silent check-offs allowed â€“ uncertainty gets you fucking fired. Like Mafee forgetting the shorts, don't be that guy.

## DONE

With these cycles we:
1. Updated the Mock API Server first as the authoritative source of the API contract
2. Refactored the API interaction layer to use "status" instead of "job_status" while maintaining internal consistency
3. Implemented backward compatibility to ensure smooth transition 
4. Updated all tests and documentation to reflect the field name change
5. Verified the refactoring works correctly with comprehensive testing

No bullshit, no uncertainty â€“ "Like Dollar Bill says, 'A rose by any other name better fucking smell the same way.'" We cleaned up that API without introducing a clusterfuck of internal changes.
