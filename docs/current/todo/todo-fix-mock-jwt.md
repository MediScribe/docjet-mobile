# TODO: Fix Mock Server JWT Generation

Reference Documentation: [Authentication Architecture](../feature-auth-architecture.md)

**Problem Diagnosis:** Our investigation revealed a critical flaw in the `mock_api_server`. During login (`/auth/login`) and token refresh (`/auth/refresh-session`), the server generates simple fake strings (e.g., `fake-access-token-12345`) instead of actual, signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). While this allows the initial login flow to *appear* successful (as the client stores these strings and the mock server likely doesn't validate tokens on protected endpoints like `/users/profile`), it completely breaks the offline authentication scenario.

When the client app restarts offline after the mock server is stopped, the `AuthService` attempts to validate the stored tokens locally using `JwtValidator`. This validator expects a real JWT structure with claims like `exp` (expiration). When it receives the fake string, parsing fails instantly, causing the local validation to report the token as invalid. This incorrectly triggers an `unauthenticated` state instead of the desired `authenticated(isOffline: true)` state, defeating the purpose of offline authentication caching.

This plan addresses this fundamental issue by modifying the mock server to generate *real* JWTs.

**Goal:** Modify the `mock_api_server` to generate real, signed JWTs with valid expiration times (`exp` claim) instead of fake strings. This will enable proper local token validation (`JwtValidator`) in the client app during offline scenarios, allowing the offline authentication flow to function as designed.

## Target Flow / Architecture

The core change is within the mock server's authentication handlers:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ClientApp as Client App
    participant MockServer as Mock API Server
    participant JwtLib as dart_jsonwebtoken

    ClientApp->>MockServer: POST /auth/login (email, pass)
    Note over MockServer: Ignores creds (it's a mock!)
    MockServer->>JwtLib: Generate Access Token (short exp)
    JwtLib-->>MockServer: accessTokenJwt
    MockServer->>JwtLib: Generate Refresh Token (long exp)
    JwtLib-->>MockServer: refreshTokenJwt
    MockServer-->>ClientApp: { access_token: accessTokenJwt, refresh_token: refreshTokenJwt, user_id: ... }

    ClientApp->>MockServer: POST /auth/refresh-session (refresh_token: previousJwt)
    Note over MockServer: Ignores incoming token (it's a mock!)
    MockServer->>JwtLib: Generate NEW Access Token
    JwtLib-->>MockServer: newAccessTokenJwt
    MockServer->>JwtLib: Generate NEW Refresh Token
    JwtLib-->>MockServer: newRefreshTokenJwt
    MockServer-->>ClientApp: { access_token: newAccessTokenJwt, refresh_token: newRefreshTokenJwt }

    ClientApp->>MockServer: GET /users/profile (Authorization: Bearer accessTokenJwt)
    MockServer->>JwtLib: Verify(accessTokenJwt)
    alt Token Valid
        JwtLib-->>MockServer: Decoded Payload
        MockServer-->>ClientApp: 200 OK { user profile data }
    else Token Invalid/Expired
        JwtLib-->>MockServer: Verification Error
        MockServer-->>ClientApp: 401 Unauthorized
    end

```

## Cycle 3: Add Basic JWT Validation to Mock Profile Endpoint (Optional but Recommended)

**Goal** Enhance the mock `/users/profile` endpoint to perform basic JWT validation using the same secret key, returning 401 if the token is missing, invalid, or expired. This makes the mock slightly more realistic.

**MANDATORY REPORTING RULE:** After *each sub-task* below and *before* ticking its checkbox, you **MUST** add a **Findings** note *and* a **Handover Brief**. No silent check-offs. Uncertainty will get you fucking fired.

* 3.1. [ ] **Research:** Review `dart_jsonwebtoken` usage for *verifying* JWTs (`JWT.verify`). Understand how to extract the token from the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
    * Findings: [...]
* 3.2. [ ] **Tests RED:** Add tests for the user profile endpoint (`_getUserProfileHandler` or similar) in a relevant test file (e.g., `mock_api_server/test/user_handlers_test.dart`).
    * Test Description:
        * `profile endpoint returns 401 Unauthorized if Authorization header is missing`
        * `profile endpoint returns 401 Unauthorized if token is malformed`
        * `profile endpoint returns 401 Unauthorized if token is signed with wrong secret`
        * `profile endpoint returns 401 Unauthorized if token is expired`
        * `profile endpoint returns 200 OK and user data if valid, non-expired token is provided`
    * Findings: [...]
* 3.3. [ ] **Implement GREEN:** Modify the user profile handler (`_getUserProfileHandler` and/or `_getUserByIdHandler`) in `mock_api_server/bin/server.dart`.
    * Add logic to extract the Bearer token from the `Authorization` header.
    * Use `JWT.verify(token, SecretKey(mockSecret))` within a try/catch block.
    * Return `Response.unauthorized()` if header is missing or verification fails (catch `JWTExpiredException`, `JWTInvalidException`, etc.).
    * If verification succeeds, return the mock profile data as before.
    * Findings: [...]
* 3.4. [ ] **Refactor:** Encapsulate token extraction and validation logic into a middleware or helper function for cleaner handlers.
    * Findings: [...]
* 3.5. [ ] **Run Cycle-Specific Tests:**
    * Command: `cd mock_api_server && dart test test/user_handlers_test.dart && cd ..` (adjust path if needed)
    * Findings: [...]
* 3.6. [ ] **Run ALL Mock Server Tests:**
    * Command: `cd mock_api_server && dart test && cd ..`
    * Findings: `[Confirm ALL mock server tests pass. FIX if not.]`
* 3.7. [ ] **Format, Analyze, and Fix (Mock Server):**
    * Command: `cd mock_api_server && dart format . && dart analyze && cd ..`
    * Findings: `[Confirm ALL formatting and analysis issues are fixed. FIX if not.]`
* 3.8. [ ] **Handover Brief:**
    * Status: Mock profile endpoint now performs basic JWT validation.
    * Gotchas: Validation is basic; doesn't check scopes or other claims beyond expiry and signature.
    * Recommendations: Proceed to final testing with the client app.

## Cycle N: Final Integration Test & Cleanup

**Goal** Verify the client application's offline authentication flow now works correctly with the modified mock server.

**MANDATORY REPORTING RULE:** After *each sub-task* below and *before* ticking its checkbox, you **MUST** add a **Findings** note *and* a **Handover Brief**. No silent check-offs. Uncertainty will get you fucking fired.

* N.1. [ ] **Task:** Run Client App with Modified Mock Server
    * Action: Execute the original test scenario:
        1. Start mock server: `cd mock_api_server && dart bin/server.dart &` (or use `run_with_mock.sh`)
        2. Run Flutter app: `flutter run -t lib/main_dev.dart`
        3. Log in.
        4. Kill the mock server (`kill <PID>`).
        5. Restart the Flutter app (hot restart or full restart).
        6. Observe logs and UI state.
    * Findings: [Record observations. Does the app now correctly show as authenticated and offline? Does `AuthCredentialsProvider` / `JwtValidator` successfully validate the token locally? Check `offline_restart.log` equivalent.]
* N.2. [ ] **Task:** Update Mock Server Documentation (Optional)
    * File: `mock_api_server/README.md`
    * Action: Add notes about JWT generation, the secret key used (`mock-secret-key`), and token lifetimes if necessary.

* N.6. [ ] **Run ALL Client Tests:**
    * Command: `./scripts/run_all_tests.sh` (or relevant test suite)
    * Findings: `[Confirm ALL relevant client tests pass, especially auth-related ones. FIX if not.]`
* N.7. [ ] **Code Review & Commit Prep:** Review *mock server* changes (`git diff --staged mock_api_server | cat`).
    * Findings: [Confirm mock server code is clean, follows principles, ready for commit.]
* N.8. [ ] **Handover Brief:**
    * Status: Mock server JWT generation fixed. Client offline auth flow verified.
    * Gotchas: Remember this is still a mock; it doesn't represent full production security.
    * Recommendations: Commit the changes to the mock server.

## DONE

With these cycles we:
1. Replaced fake token strings in `mock_api_server` with actual, signed JWTs using `dart_jsonwebtoken`.
2. Implemented correct `exp` claims allowing client-side `JwtValidator` to function correctly during offline checks.
3. (Optional) Added basic server-side token validation to the mock profile endpoint.
4. Verified the client app's offline authentication flow now works as intended against the improved mock server.
