# Audio Player Refactoring Todo Lists

This folder contains detailed todo lists for each step of the audio player refactoring process. Each list breaks down the implementation tasks into discrete, checkable items.

## Overview

The refactoring is divided into 7 major steps, each with its own todo list:

1. [Clean Up Logging](01-logging-todo.md) - Standardize logging approach (7-10 days)
2. [Fix the `seek` API](02-seek-api-todo.md) - Resolve API inconsistency (8 days)
3. [Improve Error Handling](03-error-handling-todo.md) - Standardize error handling (8 days)
4. [Simplify Stream Flow](04-stream-flow-todo.md) - Reduce stream complexity (9 days)
5. [Reduce Stateful Components](05-stateful-components-todo.md) - Consolidate state management (7 days)
6. [Reduce Coupling](06-coupling-todo.md) - Introduce context objects (7 days)
7. [Improve UI Performance](07-ui-performance-todo.md) - Enhance UI responsiveness (5 days)

## How to Use These Lists

1. Start with the first step (logging) and work through each todo item in sequence
2. Mark items as completed using the checkbox format:
   - `[ ]` - Not started/in progress
   - `[x]` - Completed
3. Only move to the next step when all items in the current step are completed
4. For each step, run the full test suite before considering it done

## Prerequisites

Before starting the refactoring, ensure:

- [ ] All existing tests are passing
- [ ] You have a clean working directory
- [ ] You have created a new branch for the refactoring
- [ ] You understand the current architecture and data flow
