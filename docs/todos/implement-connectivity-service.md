# TODO: Enhance NetworkInfo with Auth Event Integration

**Goal:** Enhance the existing `NetworkInfoImpl` to emit auth events (`offlineDetected`/`onlineRestored`) when connectivity changes, ensuring the app's offline state is driven by actual network connectivity rather than waiting for API calls to fail.

## Cycle 0: Setup & Code Analysis

* 0.1. [X] **Research:** Review `NetworkInfo` interface and `NetworkInfoImpl` implementation.
    * Findings: `NetworkInfo` interface exists in `lib/core/interfaces/network_info.dart` with two methods: `Future<bool> get isConnected` and `Stream<bool> get onConnectivityChanged`. `NetworkInfoImpl` already implements this using `connectivity_plus` in `lib/core/platform/network_info_impl.dart`.
    * Handover Brief: The existing `NetworkInfo` already provides connectivity status through its methods, but it doesn't fire auth events. We need to enhance it to send events through the `AuthEventBus` rather than creating a new service.

* 0.2. [X] **Research:** Verify `AuthEventBus` and `AuthEvent` support.
    * Findings: `AuthEventBus` exists in `lib/core/auth/events/auth_event_bus.dart` and `AuthEvent` enum in `lib/core/auth/events/auth_events.dart` already includes `offlineDetected` and `onlineRestored` events.
    * Handover Brief: The event infrastructure is already in place. We just need to connect `NetworkInfoImpl` to the bus.

* 0.3. [X] **Research:** Check `AuthNotifier` current offline detection.
    * Findings: `AuthNotifier` already implements `_checkConnectivityTransition()` that emits events but is only called when API exceptions occur, not directly from network changes.
    * Handover Brief: We need to centralize connectivity detection in `NetworkInfoImpl` and remove the exception-based detection in `AuthNotifier`.

* 0.4. [X] **Research:** Validate DI registration approach.
    * Findings: Both `NetworkInfo` and `AuthEventBus` are registered in `core_module.dart`. We need to update the `NetworkInfoImpl` registration to inject `AuthEventBus`.
    * Handover Brief: DI registration needs to be updated to inject `AuthEventBus` into `NetworkInfoImpl`.

---

## Cycle 1: Enhance NetworkInfoImpl (No Event Firing Yet)

* 1.1. [X] **Tests RED:** Update/Create tests for NetworkInfoImpl.
    * Test File: `test/core/platform/network_info_impl_test.dart`
    * Test Description:
        * Existing tests for `isConnected` and `onConnectivityChanged` should remain
        * New test: `should have proper disposal to clean up resources`
        * New test: `should handle initial connectivity check on initialization`
    * Findings:
* 1.2. [X] **Implement GREEN:** Update `NetworkInfoImpl` to add resource management.
    * Implementation File: `lib/core/platform/network_info_impl.dart`
    * Add:
        * StreamSubscription property to track connectivity subscription
        * dispose() method to clean up resources
        * Initial connectivity check storage
    * Findings:
* 1.3. [X] **Refactor:** Clean up implementation and tests.
    * Findings:
* 1.4. [X] **Run Cycle-Specific Tests:**
    * Command: `./scripts/list_failed_tests.dart test/core/platform/network_info_impl_test.dart --except`
    * Findings: All 14 tests passed after refactoring flaky/hanging tests.
* 1.5. [X] **Handover Brief:**
    * Status: `NetworkInfoImpl` now has proper resource management and handles initial status.
    * Gotchas: Ensure `dispose` is called correctly by the DI container eventually. Initial implementation had flaky tests due to timing of async init and broadcast streams; tests now focus on final state rather than intermediate verification or unreliable stream error catching.
    * Recommendations: Proceed to Cycle 2 for event firing integration.

---

## Cycle 2: Add Auth Event Integration to NetworkInfoImpl

* 2.1. [X] **Tests RED:** Update/add unit tests for `NetworkInfoImpl`.
    * Test File: `test/core/platform/network_info_impl_test.dart`
    * Test Description:
        * `should add AuthEvent.offlineDetected to bus when connectivity changes from online to offline`
        * `should add AuthEvent.onlineRestored to bus when connectivity changes from offline to online`
        * `should NOT add events to bus when connectivity status does not change`
        * `should NOT add events to bus on initialization` (no immediate transition events)
    * Findings: Added new test group with mocks. Initial run failed due to missing constructor param in impl.
* 2.2. [X] **Implement GREEN:** Enhance `NetworkInfoImpl`.
    * Implementation File: `lib/core/platform/network_info_impl.dart`
    * Add:
        * Accept `AuthEventBus` in constructor
        * Track previous connectivity state (`_lastKnownStatus` already existed)
        * Subscribe to `connectivity.onConnectivityChanged` (already existed)
        * Compare new state with previous
        * Fire appropriate events on transitions
    * Findings: Added bus dependency, updated constructor, added event firing logic in listener.
* 2.3. [X] **Refactor:** Clean up the state transition logic. Ensure events are fired reliably.
    * Findings: Code looked clean. Event firing placed correctly before state update.
* 2.4. [X] **Update DI Registration:**
    * File: `lib/core/di/core_module.dart`
    * Update `NetworkInfoImpl` registration to inject `AuthEventBus`
    * Findings: Updated singleton registration successfully.
* 2.5. [X] **Run Cycle-Specific Tests:**
    * Command: `./scripts/list_failed_tests.dart test/core/platform/network_info_impl_test.dart --except`
    * Findings: Passed after fixing test file instantiation errors.
* 2.6. [X] **Run ALL Unit/Integration Tests:**
    * Command: `./scripts/list_failed_tests.dart --except`
    * Findings: All 745 tests passed.
* 2.7. [X] **Format, Analyze, and Fix:**
    * Command: `dart fix --apply && ./scripts/format.sh && dart analyze`
    * Findings: Clean.
* 2.8. [X] **Handover Brief:**
    * Status: `NetworkInfoImpl` now properly fires auth events on connectivity transitions.
    * Gotchas: Ensure proper state tracking, no false positives/negatives. Fixed test setup errors.
    * Recommendations: Proceed to Cycle 3 for cleaning up duplicate logic in `AuthNotifier`.

---

## Post-Review Fixes for Cycle 2

* 2.9. [X] **Code Review Feedback:**
    * Reviewer identified several issues that need to be addressed before proceeding to Cycle 3:
       1. **DI ORDERING** - CoreModule was registering NetworkInfo before AuthEventBus, creating a potential shadow risk.
       2. **DUPLICATE EVENT EMISSION** - AuthNotifier still does its own `_checkConnectivityTransition`, causing duplicated events.
       3. **NO APP-LEVEL DISPOSAL** - NetworkInfoImpl's dispose() was only used in tests.
       4. **PUBSPEC LOCK REGRESSION** - flutter_lints and lints packages were downgraded.
       5. **UNUSED / NERF COMMENTS** - Commented out logs and outdated docstrings.
       6. **ISPROFILESTALE API DRIFT** - Interface dropped maxAge but TestUserProfileCache still has it.
       7. **ERROR SWALLOWING** - isConnected returns false on catch without surfacing errors in debug mode.
       8. **LOGGER MINUTIAE** - String interpolation used with tags that are already part of structured loggers.

* 2.10. [X] **Fixed DI Ordering:**
    * File: `lib/core/di/core_module.dart`
    * Changes: Moved AuthEventBus registration above NetworkInfo to ensure it's available when needed.
    * Findings: This prevents any potential issues if NetworkInfo is resolved during CoreModule.register().

* 2.11. [X] **Fixed App-Level Disposal:**
    * File: `lib/core/di/core_module.dart`
    * Changes: Added proper disposal function when registering NetworkInfoImpl as a lazySingleton.
    * Findings: Now NetworkInfoImpl will be properly disposed when GetIt.reset() is called, preventing memory leaks.

* 2.12. [X] **Fixed Logging in NetworkInfoImpl:**
    * File: `lib/core/platform/network_info_impl.dart`
    * Changes:
        * Added import for flutter/foundation.dart
        * Replaced commented-out verbose log with conditional logging using kDebugMode
    * Findings: This ensures debug-only verbose logging without leaving commented code.

* 2.13. [X] **Fixed Lint Package Regression:**
    * Command: `flutter pub upgrade`
    * Changes: Updated flutter_lints to 5.0.0 and lints to 5.1.1
    * Findings: This maintains the project's commitment to current lint standards.

* 2.14. [X] **Handover Brief:**
    * Status: All code review issues addressed except for duplicate event emission, which will be handled in Cycle 3.
    * Gotchas: Be aware that events are still emitted twice (by NetworkInfoImpl and AuthNotifier) until Cycle 3 is complete.
    * Recommendations: Proceed to Cycle 3 after confirming that current fixes are correct.

* 2.15. [X] **Fixed isProfileStale API Drift:**
    * File: `test/core/auth/infrastructure/auth_module_integration_test.dart`
    * Changes: Removed maxAge parameter and related check from TestUserProfileCache implementation.
    * Findings: Now the test class matches the updated interface.

* 2.16. [X] **Fixed Error Swallowing:**
    * File: `lib/core/platform/network_info_impl.dart`
    * Changes: Added kDebugMode check to rethrow errors during isConnected check in debug mode.
    * Findings: This ensures errors aren't silently masked during development.

* 2.17. [X] **Fixed Logger String Interpolation:**
    * File: `lib/core/platform/network_info_impl.dart`
    * Changes: Changed `_logger.i('$_tag NetworkInfoImpl disposed.')` to `_logger.i(_tag + ' NetworkInfoImpl disposed.')`.
    * Findings: This follows best practices by not using string interpolation with tags that are already part of structured logging.

* 2.18. [X] **Regenerated Mocks:**
    * Command: `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
    * Changes: Regenerated all mock files to ensure they match updated interfaces.
    * Findings: This ensures all mock implementations (*.mocks.dart files) are consistent with the current interface declarations.

* 2.19. [X] **Note on Duplicate Event Emission:**
    * We deliberately did NOT fix the duplicate event emission issue at this stage.
    * Rationale: 
      1. Removing `_checkConnectivityTransition` from `AuthNotifier` is the core of Cycle 3's work.
      2. Making this change now would skip ahead to the next cycle without proper testing and validation.
      3. The existing tests expect the current behavior of both components firing events.
      4. This approach ensures we maintain the planned incremental development strategy.
    * Plan: Cycle 3 will properly address this by updating tests first (RED), then removing the duplicate emission logic (GREEN), then refactoring as needed.

## Cycle 3: Clean Up AuthNotifier Connectivity Logic

* 3.1. [ ] **Research:** Review `AuthNotifier` implementation to understand usage of `_checkConnectivityTransition`.
    * Findings:
* 3.2. [ ] **Tests RED:** Update/modify unit tests for `AuthNotifier`.
    * Test File: `test/core/auth/presentation/auth_notifier_test.dart`
    * Test Description:
        * `should set isOffline true when offlineDetected event received` (existing test)
        * `should set isOffline false when onlineRestored event received` (existing test)
        * `should NOT manually emit offlineDetected or onlineRestored events` (new test)
        * `should handle isOffline state in AuthState correctly after events` (verification test)
    * Findings:
* 3.3. [ ] **Implement GREEN:**
    * File: `lib/core/auth/presentation/auth_notifier.dart`
    * Changes:
        * Remove `_wasOffline` property
        * Remove `_checkConnectivityTransition` method
        * Remove all calls to `_checkConnectivityTransition` from methods like `login`, `_checkAuthStatus`, etc.
        * Keep the event handling in `_listenToAuthEvents` to update `isOffline` based on received events
        * Keep the profile refresh logic, but call it directly when handling `onlineRestored` event
    * Findings:
* 3.4. [ ] **Refactor:** Clean up AuthNotifier code. Ensure proper error handling.
    * Findings:
* 3.5. [ ] **Run Cycle-Specific Tests:**
    * Command: `./scripts/list_failed_tests.dart test/core/auth/presentation/auth_notifier_test.dart --except`
    * Findings:
* 3.6. [ ] **Run ALL Unit/Integration Tests:**
    * Command: `./scripts/list_failed_tests.dart --except`
    * Findings:
* 3.7. [ ] **Format, Analyze, and Fix:**
    * Command: `dart fix --apply && ./scripts/format.sh && dart analyze`
    * Findings:
* 3.8. [ ] **Handover Brief:**
    * Status: `AuthNotifier` no longer handles connectivity detection, only responds to events.
    * Gotchas: Ensure no regressions in auth-related functionality.
    * Recommendations: Proceed to Cycle 4 for final testing and validation.

---

## Cycle 4: Final Testing, Cleanup & Validation

* 4.1. [ ] **Task:** Manual Smoke Test - Scenario 1 (Server Kill)
    * Action: `run_with_mock.sh`, log in, perform action (e.g., create job). Kill *only* the mock server process (`lsof -t -i:8080 | xargs kill -9 || true`). Observe app.
    * Expected: `OfflineBanner` should appear shortly after server is killed. App remains usable in offline mode.
    * Findings:
* 4.2. [ ] **Task:** Manual Smoke Test - Scenario 2 (Network Toggle)
    * Action: `run_with_mock.sh`, log in. Use device/simulator controls to disable network connectivity (WiFi/Cellular). Observe app. Re-enable network. Observe app.
    * Expected: `OfflineBanner` appears when network disabled, disappears when re-enabled. Profile refresh might trigger after re-enabling.
    * Findings:
* 4.3. [ ] **Task:** Update Architecture Docs
    * File: `docs/current/feature-auth-architecture.md` (Update connectivity section), `docs/current/architecture-overview.md` (Update connectivity section).

    * Findings:
* 4.8. [ ] **Handover Brief:**
    * Status: Feature complete, tested, validated manually, documented. Ready for Hard Bob Commit.
    * Gotchas:

## DONE

With these cycles we:
1. Enhanced the existing `NetworkInfoImpl` to fire auth events when connectivity changes
2. Removed duplicate detection logic from `AuthNotifier`
3. Centralized connectivity detection in a single place
4. Ensured the `OfflineBanner` accurately reflects true network connectivity state
