# Audio Player Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This refactoring will use a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach combined with parallel "green-blue" development to minimize risk and ensure behavior consistency throughout the process.

### Overall Strategy

1. **Parallel Development**: Create new implementations alongside existing ones
2. **Feature Flags**: Toggle between implementations using feature flags
3. **TDD**: Write/extend tests first, then implement to make them pass
4. **Incremental Cutover**: Switch one component at a time, verify at each step
5. **Cleanup**: Remove old code only after successful verification

## Implementation Steps & Timeline

| Step | Description | Timeline | Document |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **Clean Up Logging**: Standardize the logging approach | 7-10 days | [01-logging.md](01-logging.md) |
| 2 | **Fix the `seek` API**: Resolve the inconsistency in the API | 8 days | [02-seek-api.md](02-seek-api.md) |
| 3 | **Improve Error Handling**: Standardize error handling and propagation | 8 days | [03-error-handling.md](03-error-handling.md) |
| 4 | **Simplify Stream Flow**: Reduce stream complexity in the mapper | 9 days | [04-stream-flow.md](04-stream-flow.md) |
| 5 | **Reduce Stateful Components**: Consolidate state management | Future | [05-stateful-components.md](05-stateful-components.md) |
| 6 | **Reduce Coupling**: Introduce context objects for better encapsulation | Future | [06-coupling.md](06-coupling.md) |
| 7 | **Improve UI Performance**: Enhance the UI rendering and responsiveness | Future | [07-ui-performance.md](07-ui-performance.md) |

## Total Estimated Time

**32-35 days** of developer time, structured to minimize risk while delivering incremental improvements.

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Size**: Elimination of redundant streams and state tracking (~30-40% reduction in mapper code)
2. **Improved Readability**: Cleaner, more consistent logging and error handling
3. **Better Maintainability**: Simpler architecture with clearer responsibilities
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: More specific error recovery options and smoother UI
5. **Lower Bug Potential**: Fewer race conditions and synchronization issues
6. **Better Performance**: Reduced rebuilds and stream transformations

## Success Criteria

1. **Decreased Bug Reports**: Less issues related to player state sync
2. **Reduced Code Complexity**: Measured via static analysis tools
3. **Improved Performance**: UI frame times during seeking operations
4. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers should understand the codebase more quickly
5. **Faster Feature Development**: Adding new audio features should be easier
